        <p>Call apply bind is basically used to borrow function methods.</p>

        <h3>Call:It borrows the function method and passes the object as an argument</h3>

        <h3>What is prototype?</h3>
        <p>Prototype is a mechanism used to inherit features between objects.</p>

        <h3>What is prototype chain in JS?</h3>
        <p>Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype.That prototype object has a prototype has a prototype of its own and so on until it reaches to null as its prototype.Hence this chain is called prototype chaining.</p>
